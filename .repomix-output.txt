AD-14 ADEMS Slate Introductions




Name


Brief political bio - a few sentences describing your background and priorities.


Nick Pilch


Former Council Member and Mayor of Albany, CA, currently Planning & Zoning Commissioner. Environmentalist, with special interest in alternative transportation and housing. Co-founded Albany Strollers & Rollers. While on Planning & Zoning and the Council, I worked on Albany’s Housing Element and San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan. Sierra Club Leader, currently elected to Sierra Club California Executive Committee and other Club leadership roles. Founding member of the Albany Democratic Club, former Associate at the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee. Former Software Engineering Manager, currently employed by BART as a Train Operator, Amalgamated Transit Union 1555 member.


Sarah Bell


I have been a pro-housing organizer in Berkeley since 2020. I'm currently a lead of East Bay YIMBY, on the Board of Stewards for East Bay for Everyone, and chair of the Sierra Club Northern Alameda County Housing Committee. I also serve on Berkeley’s Housing Advisory Commission. Professionally, I’m a software engineer, and I was a founding member of the Alphabet Workers Union, serving as chair of its Legislative Political Committee until I left the company in 2024.


Neil Tsutsui


I’m a scientist and Professor of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at UC Berkeley. I’m also the Director of the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Field Research Stations, where I oversee the operations of two experimental forests, the Sagehen Creek Field Station, and the Central Sierra Snow Lab. I’ve served in a variety of environmental leadership positions including Chair of the Parks Advisory Committee for the East Bay Regional Park District, Chair of the El Cerrito Environmental Quality Committee, and Vice Chair of the West Contra Costa County Sierra Club.


Susan Wengraf


I served on the Berkeley City Council for sixteen years, representing the northeast portion of the
city. Prior to the City Council, I was on the Planning Commission and was also the President of
the Berkeley Democratic Club. Most recently I was Chair and a founding member of the East
Bay Wildfire Coalition of Governments (EBWC), advocating for a regional approach in Alameda
and Contra Costa counties to wildfire safety and mitigation. My focus of interests are housing
affordability, public safety and gun violence prevention, wildfire mitigation, accountability and
transparency in government.


Dilli Bhattarai
Dilli Bhattarai is a passionate advocate for sustainable transportation and regional connectivity. He is working to improve transit access for Hercules and the broader region. As a former Vice President of the PTO at Hercules High School and a Planning Commissioner, Dilli has a long history of community service. Now serving as a newly elected council member and Mayor for 2028, he is committed to fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and economically thriving Hercules and beyond. With over 20 years of experience managing large-scale finances in Silicon Valley, Dilli brings fiscal responsibility and strategic insight to public service.
Dilli Bhattarai is ready to represent AD-14 as an ADEM Delegate, advocating for sustainable growth, diversity, inclusive, equitable policies, and a brighter future for all. 


Andrea L. Dooley
I’m a writer and labor arbitrator who hears public and private sector grievance disputes throughout California in a broad range of industries. I’ve published two books on Labor Arbitration and am a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators. I served as an alternate member of the Oakland Police Commission at its inception in 2017 until 2019. I served as the President and Treasurer of the Oakland Technical High School Parent Teacher Student Association from 2020 until 2024. Prior to becoming a labor arbitrator, I was a partner at Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld, representing unions and their trust funds; the Northern California National Coordinator for the Coalition of Kaiser-Permanente Unions; and Safety Leader at Oakland and Richmond Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. I oversaw the AFL-CIO Voter Protection Project in Nevada during the 2008 election, and ran for the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee in 2008. As an ADEM delegate, I hope to bring my perspective on labor relations, police reform, and education, as well as my skills as a mediator and dispute resolution professional, to the table to best serve AD-14.


Teddy Vasquez Gray King
As mayor of Piedmont, I championed policies to promote housing, environmental stewardship, and improved transportation for Alameda County. Because of my efforts, Piedmont adopted a housing element that will allow construction of an historic number of homes so that families can work and live with dignity in Alameda County. As a staunch environmentalist, I passed two climate action plans that are reducing greenhouse gases; and to promote a carbon-free future, I passed legislation to build an all-electric public pool. As a member of the Alameda County Transportation Commission, I worked with representatives from throughout the county, as well as AC Transit and BART, to promote green, reliable transportation for the 21st Century. 


In addition, I’m a mom of three teenage kids, and a proud UC Berkeley graduate. I work as a public affairs consultant, and have served as an aide to a Democratic member of Congress and as chief of staff at the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Traveling out of state to support Democrats in 2024 was a great joy and reinvigorated my commitment to do as much as I can, in any way that I can, to elect Democrats to office. 


Gabriel Sandoval
I am a dedicated public servant and have worked in the California State Senate for the past four years, serving the community through the COVID-19 pandemic, for former State Senator Nancy Skinner and now State Senator Jesse Arreguín. As a staffer, I manage casework for essential safety net programs, including the California Rental Assistance Program. I also meet with regional transit partners to ensure the community’s transit needs are heard. I believe my first-hand engagement with the community of AD-14 through my role would make me an excellent delegate as I have a direct ear to constituent concerns. 


Additionally, I serve as a Planning Commissioner in the City of Pinole, where I strive to be principled in my commitment to meeting the city’s housing needs and access to public transit. As a young professional of color, equity, social justice, and economic opportunity for all are at the core of my values. My professional experiences and personal perspectives help me closely understand the needs of AD-14 and be a more connected representative.




Y’Anad Burrell
I am a lifelong health equity advocate working to ensure access to quality healthcare and mental health and wellness resources throughout Alameda and Contra Costa counties. I’ve served as a Mental Health Commissioner for Contra Costa County and on the City of Richmond’s Housing Commission. Additionally, I have been a communications co-chair for Healthy Contra Costa (formerly Healthy Richmond) since 2017.
Since 2020, I have been serving as a Community Steering Committee and Path To Clean Air (PTCA) member for Richmond, North Richmond, and San Pablo, and I co-chaired the committee from 2020 – to 2023. Under my leadership as co-chair, the CSC finalized the PTCA Implementation Plan, which includes strategies to reduce harmful air pollution that impacts people where they live, work, and play.
I am a former instructor at San Francisco State University, for their Non-Profit Certificate program, and currently a freelance journalist with the Post News Group.


Laura Babitt
For the past 16 years, I’ve worked to create just and equitable public schools in Berkeley, CA. As a School Board member, through policy and effective budgeting, I prioritized children’s needs while also improving educator pay and benefits and average of 30%, improved college eligibility rates, expanded career technical programming, improved BUSD’s climate resilience & sustainability plan, and prioritized spending to impact Berkeley’s most vulnerable students. Through the lens of effective governance, I hope to lower CA’s poverty rates, improve its public schools, and create/support organizations which positively impact lives and outcomes for CA youth.

Candidate #3
Neil Tsutsui
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: No

I’m running to be an AD14 delegate to the California Democratic Party so I can champion the progressive values that we all share. I have spent my life advocating for science, education, and the environment, and I am proud to be running with an amazing group of activists and organizers for labor, housing, transit, and justice on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. Professionally, I’m a scientist and Professor of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at UC Berkeley, where I study pollinators and invasive species and work to protect our California forests in the face of a changing climate. As Director of the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Field Research Stations, I work with federal agencies, private contractors, and state agencies to keep our forests healthy and reduce the risk of wildfires, protecting thousands of acres in the Sierra Nevada forest and neighboring communities. I also do this work closer to home. I’m grateful to have served eight years as a member of the Parks Advisory Committee for the East Bay Regional Park District (one as Chair); six years on El Cerrito’s Environmental Quality Committee (three as Chair), and two years as the Vice-chair of the West Contra Costa County Sierra Club. In this community service work, I’ve helped to weigh in on conservation plans, recreational policies, land use plans, bond measures, annual budgets, and much more, and I’m committed to bringing this same expertise to the California Democratic Party to help support our conservation and fire safety goals statewide. Finally, I deeply believe in supporting our public educational system, at both the K-12 and college levels. My three children are all currently enrolled in public schools, so I see first-hand the crucial role of these schools in our families and society, and the incredible dedication of the teachers who commit so much of their time and hearts to this important work. I’m proud to be running with the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like any other information. My email address is neiltsutsui@gmail.com

Candidate #14
Dilli Ram Bhattarai
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes

Dilli Bhattarai for Assembly District 14 Delegate A Voice for Progress, Justice, and Community-Driven Change I’m running to represent Assembly District 14 as a delegate on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. As a newly elected Hercules City Councilmember, I’m dedicated to building a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive California. Since moving to Hercules in 2021, I’ve actively contributed to our vibrant community—serving as Vice President of the Parent-Teacher Organization and a Planning Commissioner. My focus has been on creating meaningful change, from improving transit to reducing traffic and emissions, to advocating for smart growth in the East Bay. As your Assembly District Delegate, I’ll ensure the Democratic Party prioritizes the voices of everyday Californians, centering people in its agenda. My Key Priorities: •Affordable Housing & Sustainable Transportation: I’ll champion housing near jobs, schools, and transit, reducing commutes and fostering community. Investing in public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure is essential for accessible, eco-friendly cities. •Supporting Workers: I’ll fight for fair wages, safe working conditions, and protections across industries. From collective bargaining to family-friendly policies, I’ll advocate for an economy that benefits everyone, not just the privileged. •Universal Healthcare: Healthcare is a right. I’ll push for policies ensuring all Californians have access to affordable, high-quality care by expanding coverage and eliminating profiteering middlemen. •LGBTQ+ & Immigrant Rights: Diversity strengthens California. I’ll protect LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights, ensuring every person—regardless of background—feels safe, valued, and included. •Public Safety: I’ll promote wildfire prevention, emergency preparedness, and safer streets for all. These measures will enhance resilience against climate and safety challenges. I’m proud to run with the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguin and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. Together, we can build a California that works for everyone. I humbly ask for your vote to represent AD-14. Let’s drive meaningful, community-centered change together!

“The health of our communities is the heartbeat of progress and change.” I am running to represent Assembly District 14 for the Democratic Party as a delegate on the Democrats For Progress and Justice slate. I moved to Richmond/San Pablo over 30 years ago to continue my passion and intentionally focused work in health equity for children, youth, and families. For seven years I served on the Contra Costa County Mental Health Advisory Commission, for District 1 (Richmond), focusing on wellness services for children, youth and teens. This work required a review of the statewide allocation of funding to our area to ensure funds are given to community-based organizations that deliver the services needed for those in need. This work lead to my appointment to the Contra Costa Mental Health Commission for Contra Costa County. For the last eight years, I have been working in collaboration with Healthy Contra Costa (formerly Healthy Richmond) on their Access to Quality Healthcare campaign, which focuses on reducing the barriers that cause limited access to care and ensuring that residents' voices are heard when healthcare offerings are designed. In 2019, I ran for a seat on the West Contra Costa School Board, focusing on increasing the number of campus health centers, improving student academic outcomes, closing the technology gap, and fighting for education equity overall. From 2020 – 2023, I was co-chair of the Community Emissions Reduction Plan (CERP) Steering Committee for Richmond, North Richmond, and San Pablo, CA, formed in 2020 under Assembly Bill 617 (AB617). Its purpose is to improve air quality in the community by reducing emissions and addressing air pollution. Under my leadership as co-chair, this committee completed a Path to Clean Air Implementation Plan, and I am continuing to serve as a member of this committee, focusing on the community benefits that are a part of this plan. I am dedicated and committed to being an equity voice for quality education, universal healthcare and breaking the systemic barriers that impact the social determinants of health (i.e. health, housing, and education, and economic development). I’m proud to be running on the Democrats For Progress and Justice slate, which is endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguin.

I am running to represent Assembly District 14 as a delegate on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. As a labor arbitrator and fiction writer, I am challenged every day to use my imagination to craft solutions to improve relationships among adversaries. Often, I need to act decisively, but I’m always expected to explain my reasoning. I believe these skills will serve me as an ADEM delegate. We cannot keep having the same arguments that don’t change minds or improve people’s lives; we need new ideas and decisive action to confront the complex challenges we face. We need to re-imagine communities that are centered on people, families, and jobs, not cars and billionaires. We need to build more housing closer to good jobs that pay sustainable living wages. We need affordable transit, high quality education, and universal health care that meets the needs of all Californians. We need to solve the problems of quality child care, elder services, accessible quality healthcare, and housing as a community, not as individuals. The community of California has the resources and capacity to build the systems we need to ease the difficulties each of us has as individuals. I’ve worked in the labor movement for almost 30 years, and believe that strong unions build strong communities and strong families. I believe that a transparent and accountable government, including transparency in budgeting and decision-making, strengthens those communities and deepens trust in the systems we create. I’ve been an active member of my community. As the President and Treasurer of the Oakland Technical High School PTSA, I worked to support educators and strengthen our public schools. California needs to deepen its commitment to education from preschool through adult learning. As a labor lawyer, I protected the rights of workers and the rights of unions to organize and bargain for their workers. As the AFL-CIO Voter Protection Project coordinator in Nevada in 2008, I worked to ensure a fair election. As a member of the Oakland Police Commission, I worked for police reform. I am proud to be endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, leaders who share our vision for progress and justice. Please vote for Andrea Dooley to represent AD-14 and help move our state forward. andrealdooley@gmail.com

Susan Wengraf

Executive Board Candidate: Yes

I’m running for Assembly District Delegate to represent AD-14 in the California Democratic Party. I will advocate for wildfire mitigation, access to healthcare, affordable housing, and fiscal responsibility and transparency. With more than 30 years of public service as a teacher, Planning Commissioner, City Councilmember, and Vice Mayor in Berkeley, I offer a balanced, independent, and pragmatic approach. I have the knowledge, experience, and thoughtful perspective to governance that the Democratic Party needs. I have a proven record of effective, data driven problem solving, collaboration, and consensus building. Safety, climate resilience and wildfire mitigation, access to affordable health care, housing for middle-income families, good paying jobs and work conditions, quality schools and education, gun violence prevention, and accountability are my focus. My priorities are based on our shared values: a balanced approach to a fair and just, diverse, democratic, safe, sustainable future. We need leaders who can make good progressive ideas a reality. A few examples of my effective leadership are: •Raising $9 million per year for emergency response and wildfire mitigation efforts in Berkeley through Measure FF (2022). •Founding member and Chair of the East Bay Wildfire Coalition of Governments, approaching climate adaptation from a regional perspective. •Legalizing non permitted secondary units, bringing empty units back into productive use. •Undergrounding power lines along key evacuation routes, keeping residents safe. •Establishing public EV charging stations for residents without access. •Improved communication through the UC/City of Berkeley Relations Committee. I am a life-long Democrat and was the President of the Berkeley Democratic Club for eight years. I also represented the City of Berkeley on regional agencies, collaborating with our neighbors to bring progress to the East Bay. I am running with others on the “Democrats for Progress and Justice” Slate, a group of progressive, and intelligent colleagues with years of proven effectiveness, collective knowledge, and experience. Our slate is endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, and State Senator Jesse Arreguin. Please vote for Susan Wengraf and the “Democrats for Progress and Justice” Slate.

I am running in the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate because I want to support environmental, housing justice, transportation justice, voting reform, social justice, and other progressive issues in the Party. I am proud our slate is endorsed by the Assembly Member Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín. I’ve previously been an AD14 Associate Member and President of the Albany Democratic Club. I served 6 years as Council Member and Mayor in Albany, and a total of 13 years on City Commissions. I am currently a member of the County Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee and elected member of Sierra Club leadership. I co-founded Albany Strollers & Rollers. I am a union member (ATU 1555). We must continue to dissociate completely from fossil fuel interests, and invest in local clean energy. The Party must support the fight against the investor-owned utilities which are trying to make it harder to deploy rooftop solar. Distributed renewable energy is our best bet. At Albany City Council I also helped pass legislation that currently funds climate action programs. The Party must support legislation that breaks down the barriers to building the housing we need at all affordability levels, and keep up the fight for tenant’s rights. I championed legislation that makes housing easier to build in Albany, and have been working as a housing advocate for many years and was endorsed by a number of housing advocacy organizations. Our State must support transportation equity - we need continued and further investment in bus, transit, bicycling, and walking for those who can’t afford the great expense of a car. This investment also furthers the right environmental goals. We should enable people to use clean and efficient transport. The Party must continue to support universal healthcare. California could implement its own program. The Party must also continue to support public education, and public safety, including wildfire safety, and safe streets. As Mayor of Albany, I began the process that culminated in the formation of Albany first Policing Commission providing community oversight of the police, a rarity in such a small City. Also as Mayor, the Pride flag flew for the entire Pride Month for the first time in Albany. I would be honored to have your vote along with the rest of the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. nicky@mindspring.com

Sarah Bell
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No

I’m running for ADEMS with the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, to build a sustainable California where working families have a chance to thrive. I’ll champion more housing near jobs, schools, and transit, along with fair wages, workers’ rights, and universal healthcare.
For the past four years, I’ve been a pro-housing organizer and leader with East Bay YIMBY and East Bay for Everyone because I know that every home we build deeply changes someone’s life. With these organizations, I’ve led grassroots mobilization for affordable housing near BART, fairer housing elements, and safer streets, especially for bicyclists and pedestrians. I also chair the Sierra Club Northern Alameda County Housing Committee, where we advocate for sustainable infill housing instead of sprawl in high-fire-risk areas.
Housing isn’t the only thing working families need to thrive: we need good, secure jobs where workers are respected and valued. That’s why, when I was at Alphabet, I helped found the Alphabet Workers Union. We fought for living wages for all our coworkers, to make contract workers permanent employees with benefits, for immigrants’ rights in the workplace, to fight gender bias, and to protect from retaliation any colleagues who raised concerns. We also pushed our employer to show up better in the world, demanding they suspend YouTubers engaged in homophobic speech and sever ties with pro-fossil-fuel lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce.
I believe we can build a California where folks can easily find a home to fit their needs, where they can get a secure job, where everyone has healthcare, where we invest in childcare and education, and where we stand up for civil rights for all, but especially LGBTQ rights, immigrants’ rights, and bodily autonomy in these times. I’m proud to be running along with the rest of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, to help advance these progressive causes. Join us!

Laura Babitt
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No

For 16 years, I have dedicated myself to building just and equitable public schools in Berkeley, CA. As a School Board member, I championed policies and budgets that prioritize our children’s needs, while also achieving an average increase of 30% in educator pay and benefits. My efforts led to improved college eligibility rates, expanded career technical education, and enhanced climate resilience and sustainability plans within BUSD. I focused spending on initiatives which supported Berkeley’s most vulnerable students both socially and academically. As a community leader and organizer, I actively supported initiatives that tackle gun violence, promote affordable housing, enhance mental health services, advocate for sustainable transportation, and address climate change. Through effective governance, I aim to lower California’s poverty rates, enhance our public schools, and partner with organizations that will positively impact the lives of our youth and young adults. I am proud to be part of the Buffy Wick's endorsed Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, committed to electing leaders who will genuinely respond to the needs of our communities. We need leaders with courage, resilience, and tenacity to ensure that the next generation has access to essential human rights: quality education, affordable housing, sustainable healthcare, and a united effort to protect our planet. I will support candidates and initiatives that will prioritize spending wisely, whether facing budget shortfalls or surpluses. As a leader of the next generation and Controller of Global Operations, I understand the importance of outcome-oriented governance. I promise to work diligently to ensure that AD-14 supports efforts and leaders which truly put the needs of the people first.

Fellow Democrats, we MUST ensure that our vital policy deeds match our political words. We must unite to push back against Trump and make sure California is a beacon of democracy and sane policies. We have a strong state Party platform, but it’s only any good if our elected officials pay attention to it. We must work together to have an inclusive, grassroots-oriented state Party, elect liberal-progressive Democrats throughout CA, and hold our state elected leaders accountable. I just finished 12 years on the Oakland City Council, I’m proud to have earned a reputation as an effective policymaker. Throughout my career, I have worked as an environmental policy director, public interest & social justice advocate, and progressive reformer. I continue to be a leader on affordable housing, bold action on climate change, anti-gun violence, emergency preparedness, public education and more. I have decades of experience as a political campaign activist, volunteer and policy advisor. I’m a past VP of the MGO Democratic Club, member of Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club, and longstanding member of the CDP Environmental Caucus. I worked full-time for the Union of Concerned Scientists promoting clean energy and reduced emissions, while standing up to oil companies and other polluters. Most everyone in our Party claims to be an environmentalist. But when push comes to shove, too many public officials forget that commitment. We must elect delegates who are proven climate leaders who will push our elected officials to be as well. I’m a former staff member for CA Common Cause. As a Party delegate, I will continue to advocate for CLEAN MONEY elections! I have the hands-on, rough-and-tumble experience in state party politics, and we need to cut through the bureaucracy and push our Party to take strong action on a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Affordable Housing, Public Education, standing up to the NRA to get guns off our streets, and loudly standing up against hate, racism, antisemitism, and all forms bigotry! I'm 100% pro-choice! Delegates must volunteer on Dem campaigns and help organize others to volunteer. I've done that and will continue to do so. As always, I'm committed to serving with dedication and integrity. Let’s elect strong environmental and social justice leaders in our Party. dan@dankalb.net Democrats for Progress and Social Justice - 14th A.D.

Anthony Edward Caro
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes

I am running to represent AD14 in the California Democratic Party to advocate for our education system, worker's rights, and universal healthcare. As a member of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, and having the endorsements of Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín, I will leverage these relationships to push for effective and sustainable policies. My experience has been primarily in education policy. I ran for the West Contra Costa Unified School District School Board in 2018 and the Contra Costa County Board of Education in 2024. In addition, I've worked as a community organizer. Working with different families, labor partners, and other community stakeholders, I have learned and advocated for progressive education policy to improve our school system. We need policies that support our teachers, set our students up for successful careers, and build upon the community schools model. Worker's rights are always at the forefront of my priorities. My wife, Mitzi Pérez-Caro, is in the middle of her eighth year as a high school teacher, and she previously served on the executive board of her labor union. We can only build upon the community infrastructure we need to pass and implement effective policy by supporting our labor partners. I come from a military background. After losing my 2018 election at 21, I enlisted in the United States Army, serving four years in Active Duty and the last two years in the Army National Guard. As a Sergeant and Non-commissioned Officer, I've learned the meaning of Servant Leadership and would like to continue to serve my community as a delegate to the California Democratic Party. For the last year and a half, I've served as Treasurer to the West County Democratic Club. Having been endorsed by the club and the Democratic Party of Contra Costa County for my past campaigns, I want to do my part to serve our organizations and local Democrats at the state level. I'm committed to helping the party evolve into what it needs to be to serve our communities better. That includes providing my perspective as a member of Gen Z and husband to a teacher. I am running for ADEM because we need a broader approach to pushing for sound and progressive policies. It's not enough to elect the right people into office. We need a party platform that will hold each other accountable to commitments of progress.

Teddy Gray King

Executive Board Candidate: Yes

Teddy Gray King, AD 14 In this moment of uncertainty, I believe that effective California Democrats are our best hope to promote a sustainable, just, and secure future. As we consider the coming four years, California must stand firm for progressive values like fair housing, climate action, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights. If elected to represent AD 14 at the California Democratic Party, I understand the tasks ahead to make our party more relevant. They include: Reinvigorating voter contact at the neighborhood and community level. Growing state party operations to ensure that Democrats are viable in every district and in every election cycle - not only Presidential elections. Recruiting great candidates. The California Democratic Party should be an instrument in finding and training excellent candidates from diverse backgrounds. We cannot win if we don’t have candidates who connect with voters. As a part of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, I’m proud to have the endorsement of Senator Jesse Arriguin and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. As former mayor of Piedmont, California, I worked to promote progressive and sustainable policies. These include climate action policies that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions in our city, pro-labor contracts to protect city workers - including our first responders - and I made expansion of multi-family housing a cornerstone of my term in office. I am proud that under my leadership, Piedmont adopted a plan to add housing units so that more families with school-age children could benefit from excellent public schools. As a second generation Mexican-American, I care passionately about immigrant communities. That’s why I serve on the board of a non-profit economic development and housing developer that helps to ensure that the Latino community has a fair shot at good jobs, housing, and a quality education. I work every day to promote economic justice for my fellow members of the Latino community We have to be a party that is future focused, that listens to the concerns of every resident. A party capable of rolling up its sleeves and providing effective leadership. I know that by working hard, and working together, we can do just that. I appreciate your vote. If you would like to contact me directly, my email address is teddygrayking@gmail.com.

Gabriel Sandoval
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: No

I am a dedicated public servant and have worked in the California State Senate for the past four years, serving the community through the COVID-19 pandemic, for former State Senator Nancy Skinner and now State Senator Jesse Arreguín. As a staffer, I manage casework for essential safety net programs, including the California Rental Assistance Program. I also meet with regional transit partners to ensure the community’s transit needs are heard. I believe my first-hand engagement with the community of AD-14 through my role would make me an excellent delegate as I have a direct ear to constituent concerns. Additionally, I serve as a Planning Commissioner in the City of Pinole, where I strive to be principled in my commitment to meeting the city’s housing needs and access to public transit. As a young professional of color, I would work to advance California’s goals in addressing equity, social justice, and economic opportunity. My professional experiences and personal perspectives help me closely understand the needs of AD-14 and be a more connected representative. I am happy to be running alongside my colleagues on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. In addition, I am privileged to have the support of our local state representatives.
