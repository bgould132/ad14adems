Candidate #1
Alfred Twu
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


I’m Alfred Twu, and I’m running to continue the work on housing and transportation, Single Payer Healthcare, getting corporate money out of politics, and helping all Democrats get organized. As a delegate, I've helped people learn how our party works through presentations and drawings, helped write resolutions, form organizations, and plug into campaigns. I myself have written and supported resolutions and party platform updates on traffic safety and high speed rail. In 2023, I was part of the movement that won state relief to save our local transit systems from running out of funding. I've also served as Secretary of the California Democratic Renters Council, organizing candidate forums, and building support for tenant rights, affordable housing, building new homes, solar and electrification. I am also on the boards of the CA Dem Party Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, the East Bay Stonewall Democrats (our local LGBTQ Democratic group), and the Asian Pacific American Democratic Caucus of Alameda County. I work as an architect and artist, and am on the Rent Board and Planning Commission in Berkeley. In 2020, I was a Bernie delegate to the Democratic National Convention. I like birds. I am running again with the Progressive Labor Slate. We're not going back - we're going forward, and the East Bay is where we lead the resistance and build the path to a progressive future. Feel free to reach out to me at alfred@alfredtwu.org - always happy to introduce people to the CA Dem Party, local politics, or running for office.

Avery Arbaugh
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


I’m Avery Arbaugh, and I’m running for ADEM Delegate to fight for workers, tenants, and climate justice, and to get corporate money out of our politics. As a local progressive community organizer I’ve worked to get progressive legislation passed to help tenants afford their rents and to help increase transparency in our policymaking process. As President of the Cal Berkeley Democrats, I picketed with UAW student workers standing up for a fair contract, advocated for affordable housing and against the displacement of low-income tenants, and pushed California to pass state-level policies to move towards a green economy. As a Labor Commissioner for the City of Berkeley, I’ve monitored the implementation of pro-worker city policies and fought for workers facing unfair labor practices and bad-faith contract negotiations. As an ADEM Delegate, I will keep up the fight, by pushing the Democratic Party to champion economic policies that allow working-class people to thrive, including Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, mass public transit, and social housing. I will advocate for a party platform favoring peace abroad, and restorative justice at home, and to create a Democratic Party that works for working people. I am running with the Progressive Labor Slate and with the endorsement of the Progressive Delegates Network, and I hope to work in coalition with other delegates to help our party move away from corporate influence and to improve our responsiveness to the concerns of working Californians.

Neil Tsutsui
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: No


I’m running to be an AD14 delegate to the California Democratic Party so I can champion the progressive values that we all share. I have spent my life advocating for science, education, and the environment, and I am proud to be running with an amazing group of activists and organizers for labor, housing, transit, and justice on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. Professionally, I’m a scientist and Professor of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at UC Berkeley, where I study pollinators and invasive species and work to protect our California forests in the face of a changing climate. As Director of the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Field Research Stations, I work with federal agencies, private contractors, and state agencies to keep our forests healthy and reduce the risk of wildfires, protecting thousands of acres in the Sierra Nevada forest and neighboring communities. I also do this work closer to home. I’m grateful to have served eight years as a member of the Parks Advisory Committee for the East Bay Regional Park District (one as Chair); six years on El Cerrito’s Environmental Quality Committee (three as Chair), and two years as the Vice-chair of the West Contra Costa County Sierra Club. In this community service work, I’ve helped to weigh in on conservation plans, recreational policies, land use plans, bond measures, annual budgets, and much more, and I’m committed to bringing this same expertise to the California Democratic Party to help support our conservation and fire safety goals statewide. Finally, I deeply believe in supporting our public educational system, at both the K-12 and college levels. My three children are all currently enrolled in public schools, so I see first-hand the crucial role of these schools in our families and society, and the incredible dedication of the teachers who commit so much of their time and hearts to this important work. I’m proud to be running with the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like any other information. My email address is neiltsutsui@gmail.com

Jamin Pursell
OSIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


My name is Jamin Pursell, and I am running to represent our community as a Delegate because I believe grassroots leadership shapes the future of our party. ADEMs ensure our community’s values and priorities are reflected at the state level, and I am committed to being a strong, inclusive, and progressive voice for our district. I currently serve as president of the West County Democratic Club, where I work to unite our party around civic engagement. I am a founding board member and art director of Richmond Rainbow Pride, co-chair of the Richmond Shoreline Alliance, and a steering committee member of the Richmond Progressive Alliance. These roles have allowed me to collaborate with community leaders to advance effective policies and engagement. My academic background includes degrees in political science, philosophy, and law, with a focus on human rights, social justice, and governance. These experiences have equipped me to navigate systemic challenges and advocate for meaningful change. In 2022, I ran a grassroots progressive campaign for Richmond City Council, funded by individual donors and endorsed by the Democratic Party of Contra Costa County, the Sierra Club, labor unions, and leaders across the Bay Area. My campaign rejected corporate, developer, and police union contributions, reinforcing my commitment to people-powered politics. That experience strengthened my belief in standing up to special interests while championing policies that support working families and environmental sustainability. As a Delegate, I will bring this energy and commitment to representing our district. ADEMs amplify the voices of our communities and ensure our shared values—justice, equity, and sustainability—are central to the Democratic Party’s agenda. I am dedicated to broadening engagement, mentoring new leaders, and advocating for solutions to pressing challenges. I will ensure our voices are heard and lead efforts to address systemic issues and promote equity. By fostering collaboration and advocating for policies that improve quality of life, I will strive to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. I remain committed to Environmental Justice, Just Transition, the Green New Deal, Bodily Autonomy rights, LGBT rights, Police Reform, Medicare for All, Tenants’ rights, and Affordable Housing.

Kate Harrison

Executive Board Candidate: Yes


Berkeley City Councilmember (2017-24), ADEM Delegate, founder, Berkeley Progressive Alliance, Local Politics Chair, Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club, and member of DSA, Our Revolution, and 350 Bay Area* I am proud to be running as a delegate on the Progressive Labor Slate, committed to hearing from you and ensuring that the Democratic Party stands with our progressive values. We need to engage people in the Democratic Party, whose policies and actions are too often decided behind closed doors. We need people who are not afraid to stand up to monied interests. My work demonstrates that commitment. I bring decades of community and political engagement in progressive economic, land use, and social justice policies. As a Berkeley City Councilmember, I led the fight to decarbonize our housing and transportation through the nation’s first ban on natural gas in new construction and creation of the Climate Equity Fund; promote labor rights through the Fair Work Week; write and lead the campaign for the Vacancy Tax on the 2022 ballot; increase requirements and provide funding for affordable housing; promote tenant ownership; and revise our Charter to create an independent Police Accountability Board. I cofounded and coauthored the platform of the Berkeley Progressive Alliance. For the Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club, I fought for corporations paying their fair share under Proposition 13, for criminal justice reform and for a living wage. I have served on the Dorothy Day House and Berkeley Food and Housing Project Board, providing a safety net and transition to permanent housing for those without homes. I was a paid organizer or volunteer for national, state, and local campaigns, including those of Bernie Sanders, Tony Thurmond, and Barack Obama. I first became engaged in my community as a student senator and public policy graduate student at U,C. Berkeley. I have devoted my professional life to public service. I own and manage a consulting firm that helps states and nations create independent and accessible justice systems and guard the rights of the poor, those without lawyers and families. As an advisor to San Francisco Mayor and the State of California I wrote and led passage of statewide legislation. I understand how the mechanics of government works and how to get things done in politics. *Titles for identification purposes only

Candidate #8
Lisa Dianne Stockwell-Gardner
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No


Hello, Democrats of Assembly District 14!
I’m Lisa Gardner - a proud Gen-X mom to three daughters, member of the Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (AANHPI) community, business owner, activist and organizer. I’m running to bring a practical, family-focused perspective to our Democratic Party, while advocating for bold solutions to the challenges we face.
Leadership Rooted in Service and Action
After the 2016 election, I turned my focus to grassroots activism. With Sister District, East Bay Activist Alliance (EBAA); and more recently, with Neighbors for Progressive Action (NPA) and Movement Voter Project, I continue to mobilize volunteers, raise critical funds, and amplify progressive candidates at all levels.
As a 2nd-term Recreation Commissioner for Piedmont and Program Committee member of the League of Women Voters of Piedmont, I’m working tirelessly to increase voter engagement, strengthen community programs, and protect our democracy.
I’ve spent decades rolling up my sleeves—whether leading Girl Scout troops (15 years), organizing events and community fundraisers, or fighting for Democratic values—to create stronger communities. I know what it takes to nurture growth, build connections, and get things done.
A Vision for Our Future
As a delegate, I’m running to ensure our California Democratic Party not only fights for the values that matter to families like yours and mine, but also secures wins in elections with strong, clear messaging that inspires and unifies voters and counters divisive strategies. My priorities are:
Affordable Housing so every family can thrive;
Climate Action to secure a livable planet for our kids;
Economic Justice that lifts up working families and the less fortunate;
Equity and Inclusion to celebrate and protect our diversity; and expand and grow our party.
As a mom, AANHPI advocate, business owner and community leader, who’s spent years juggling responsibilities while fighting for a better future, I understand the stakes. Let’s work together to build a stronger, more inclusive Democratic Party and a brighter future for all.
I’d be honored to have your vote.

Sadia Khan
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: No


I am Sadia Khan, and I’m running to continue advocating for and working on issues like affordable and safe housing, uplifting and supporting survivors of domestic violence, k-16 education funding and preventing forced marriage in California. Over the past decade I have had the privilege of supporting voter registration efforts, voter education and ensuring voting information is available to everyone regardless of their preferred language, in fact I helped draft a best practices guide for registrars offices to utilize to ensure language access for all voters. This Best Practices guide now lives on our CA Secretary of Staes website as a guide for all to utilize. This past year I worked to ensure adequate funding for victims of crimes to ensure that domestic violence agencies across California have the appropriate funding to keep survivors safe. I am also currently working to bring legislation that would allow survivors of violence to see housing accommodations such as the ability to install a ring camera, or move to a comparable unit and more. Additionally, I am working to introduce legislation that will create protective orders for individuals facing threats of forced marriage or have been forced into a marriage to seek protections. Outside of my professional work I have spent years working around food insecurity and ensuring that our communities have access to food. During and after my time as a UC Berkeley student, I proactively organized to expand the Bear Pantry, hosting community building events, bringing much needed resources to UC Village and advocating for students at the UC level and statewide level. Prior to this work I helped create a food pantry at my Community College in southern California as well. In all of my work I do my best to center the voices of those most impacted by the issue. I would love to continue to build and continue my work to ensure the most vulnerable members of our community are safe and supported. I am running again with the Progressive-Labor Slate and hope to earn your support! Feel free to reach out to me at khan42166@gmail.com - I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

My name is Carol Coyote Cook and I am running as an incumbent to continue my work as a delegate in Assembly District 14. I am committed to working within the Democratic Party to bring about changes that will benefit people, not corporations. Through any votes I am able to make as a delegate, I will always vote for putting people first. I am particularly interested in working on healthcare and housing for all, as well as living wages, reforming the justice system and our climate catastrophe. I am the founder and co-chair of Our Revolution East Bay, which endorses and supports only candidates with very strong progressive values. I was elected to serve as a delegate, (alternate), for Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2000. For two years I served on the board of the Berkeley Tenants Union - I strongly believe that housing is a human right and this group works to defend and advance the rights of Berkeley renters. For over 10 years I have been a member and on the Steering Committee of the Karl Linn Garden, one of the community gardens in Berkeley - We advocate for accessible and healthy food for all. Primarily I consider myself an activist and organizer with my activist roots going back to the 1960's when I was heavily involved in the anti-war movement. I have received the endorsement of the Progressive Delegate Network, a network of grassroots change makers committed to transforming the California Democratic Party. With my current and past involvement in issues that support people in having better lives, you can always count on me to vote in ways that will benefit all of us. I would be honored to have your vote as would my fellow slate-mates on the Progressive Labor Slate.

Dilli Bhattarai for Assembly District 14 Delegate A Voice for Progress, Justice, and Community-Driven Change I’m running to represent Assembly District 14 as a delegate on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. As a newly elected Hercules City Councilmember, I’m dedicated to building a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive California. Since moving to Hercules in 2021, I’ve actively contributed to our vibrant community—serving as Vice President of the Parent-Teacher Organization and a Planning Commissioner. My focus has been on creating meaningful change, from improving transit to reducing traffic and emissions, to advocating for smart growth in the East Bay. As your Assembly District Delegate, I’ll ensure the Democratic Party prioritizes the voices of everyday Californians, centering people in its agenda. My Key Priorities: •Affordable Housing & Sustainable Transportation: I’ll champion housing near jobs, schools, and transit, reducing commutes and fostering community. Investing in public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure is essential for accessible, eco-friendly cities. •Supporting Workers: I’ll fight for fair wages, safe working conditions, and protections across industries. From collective bargaining to family-friendly policies, I’ll advocate for an economy that benefits everyone, not just the privileged. •Universal Healthcare: Healthcare is a right. I’ll push for policies ensuring all Californians have access to affordable, high-quality care by expanding coverage and eliminating profiteering middlemen. •LGBTQ+ & Immigrant Rights: Diversity strengthens California. I’ll protect LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights, ensuring every person—regardless of background—feels safe, valued, and included. •Public Safety: I’ll promote wildfire prevention, emergency preparedness, and safer streets for all. These measures will enhance resilience against climate and safety challenges. I’m proud to run with the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguin and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. Together, we can build a California that works for everyone. I humbly ask for your vote to represent AD-14. Let’s drive meaningful, community-centered change together!

Cecilia Lunaparra

Executive Board Candidate: No


I am Cecilia Lunaparra, a Berkeley City Councilmember representing District 7, a student-supermajority district that includes the UC Berkeley campus and Southside neighborhood. I am the first Latina, the first queer woman of color, and the first undergraduate student to serve on the Berkeley City Council. I am running to represent the young, progressive faction of the Democratic Party in AD-14—a group that is more essential than ever to building the equitable society we hope to create. As a Berkeley City Councilmember, I have focused on building and preserving abundant, accessible, and affordable housing, establishing a robust public transportation system and safe street infrastructure, and a public safety strategy designed to address the root causes of crime. I have strong relationships with student and community organizations and coalitions both on and off campus. I am fundamentally committed to fighting for housing justice built through rent control, tenants’ protections, and abundance. I am committed to a pro-housing, pro-tenant rights Progressive future for our City, our region, and our Party. As a UC Berkeley student in Urban Studies and History, I served as the President of Cal Berkeley Democrats, the official arm of the Democratic Party on UC Berkeley’s campus, and of Telegraph for People, a progressive urbanist organization on campus. I created a coalition designed to give motivated students the tools and support they need to fight for progressive legislation and support Democratic candidates and policies. As your California Democratic Party Delegate, I will continue to direct young passion for civic engagement towards issues that affect our communities and beyond—accessible transportation, the preservation of public spaces, housing abundance and affordability, concrete and radical environmentalism, unions and workers’ rights, equitable criminal justice, preservation and enhancement of public education, immigration reform, reproductive and gender justice, universal healthcare, pro-union infrastructure investment, and more. As we step into uncertain and alarming times, it is our responsibility to ensure that our local Democratic Party is representative of our diverse coalition and relentlessly fights for human and civil rights locally, nationally, and globally. Thank you for your participation and consideration, and I hope to have your support.

SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


“The health of our communities is the heartbeat of progress and change.” I am running to represent Assembly District 14 for the Democratic Party as a delegate on the Democrats For Progress and Justice slate. I moved to Richmond/San Pablo over 30 years ago to continue my passion and intentionally focused work in health equity for children, youth, and families. For seven years I served on the Contra Costa County Mental Health Advisory Commission, for District 1 (Richmond), focusing on wellness services for children, youth and teens. This work required a review of the statewide allocation of funding to our area to ensure funds are given to community-based organizations that deliver the services needed for those in need. This work lead to my appointment to the Contra Costa Mental Health Commission for Contra Costa County. For the last eight years, I have been working in collaboration with Healthy Contra Costa (formerly Healthy Richmond) on their Access to Quality Healthcare campaign, which focuses on reducing the barriers that cause limited access to care and ensuring that residents' voices are heard when healthcare offerings are designed. In 2019, I ran for a seat on the West Contra Costa School Board, focusing on increasing the number of campus health centers, improving student academic outcomes, closing the technology gap, and fighting for education equity overall. From 2020 – 2023, I was co-chair of the Community Emissions Reduction Plan (CERP) Steering Committee for Richmond, North Richmond, and San Pablo, CA, formed in 2020 under Assembly Bill 617 (AB617). Its purpose is to improve air quality in the community by reducing emissions and addressing air pollution. Under my leadership as co-chair, this committee completed a Path to Clean Air Implementation Plan, and I am continuing to serve as a member of this committee, focusing on the community benefits that are a part of this plan. I am dedicated and committed to being an equity voice for quality education, universal healthcare and breaking the systemic barriers that impact the social determinants of health (i.e. health, housing, and education, and economic development). I’m proud to be running on the Democrats For Progress and Justice slate, which is endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguin.

Hello all! I am a student leader and advocate bringing youth representation to the California Democratic Party! I grew up to be progressive and forward-thinking as an East Bay native, but my interest in getting involved with politics stemmed from the world events I witnessed in 2020 and beyond. I refuse to be an onlooker as others tear apart our country and our planet, so I am energetically working to build my career in policymaking! I am honored to be a part of the Progressive-Labor slate and to be endorsed by the Progressive Delegates Network in this race! We as a party need to get more young people involved in politics! Half of eligible 18-29 year olds do not vote, even in key elections! It is clear that they are frustrated and estranged from our political processes. We need to take charge of the discourse and champion proven solutions to the crises at the forefront of their lives. Increase construction, subsidization, and densification of housing to lower the cost of rent. Further expand renewable energy and climate proof our infrastructure to prepare for novel weather events. Regulate our healthcare companies to provide affordable and reasonably attainable physical and mental health services for all customers. And prioritize legislation promoting public transportation, walking, and biking to encourage healthy, active lifestyles from an early age. As a delegate, I will do my part to ensure that we further these and other agendas to the greatest extent possible! Compared to many of my associates, I am not as politically experienced. However, I make up for that with my exemplified dedication to serving as an informed, participatory representative and volunteer! Since the summer of 2024, I have had the opportunity to canvass and phonebank for multiple campaigns, become a regional leader for a small organization mobilizing volunteers for progressive causes, directly advocate against service cuts to public transportation with the East Bay Transit Riders Union, participate as a member of my student government, and join the executive board of the East Bay Young Democrats as Chief of Staff. My momentum is holding strong for 2025! I thank you for entrusting me to represent the next generation of voters and become part of the next generation of leaders. You can email me at correspondence@gjordan.org or find my LinkedIn for more info!

Andrea Dooley
SIF
Executive Board Candidate: Yes


I am running to represent Assembly District 14 as a delegate on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. As a labor arbitrator and fiction writer, I am challenged every day to use my imagination to craft solutions to improve relationships among adversaries. Often, I need to act decisively, but I’m always expected to explain my reasoning. I believe these skills will serve me as an ADEM delegate. We cannot keep having the same arguments that don’t change minds or improve people’s lives; we need new ideas and decisive action to confront the complex challenges we face. We need to re-imagine communities that are centered on people, families, and jobs, not cars and billionaires. We need to build more housing closer to good jobs that pay sustainable living wages. We need affordable transit, high quality education, and universal health care that meets the needs of all Californians. We need to solve the problems of quality child care, elder services, accessible quality healthcare, and housing as a community, not as individuals. The community of California has the resources and capacity to build the systems we need to ease the difficulties each of us has as individuals. I’ve worked in the labor movement for almost 30 years, and believe that strong unions build strong communities and strong families. I believe that a transparent and accountable government, including transparency in budgeting and decision-making, strengthens those communities and deepens trust in the systems we create. I’ve been an active member of my community. As the President and Treasurer of the Oakland Technical High School PTSA, I worked to support educators and strengthen our public schools. California needs to deepen its commitment to education from preschool through adult learning. As a labor lawyer, I protected the rights of workers and the rights of unions to organize and bargain for their workers. As the AFL-CIO Voter Protection Project coordinator in Nevada in 2008, I worked to ensure a fair election. As a member of the Oakland Police Commission, I worked for police reform. I am proud to be endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, leaders who share our vision for progress and justice. Please vote for Andrea Dooley to represent AD-14 and help move our state forward. andrealdooley@gmail.com

Executive Board Candidate: No


I am excited to announce my candidacy for Assembly District Delegate, bringing over a 17 years of experience in data-driven political strategy and community engagement. My commitment to progressive change and grassroots organizing aligns with the California Democratic Party's mission to build long-term coalitions and mobilize voters year-round. As a first-generation immigrant with family from Iran, I value representation and inclusive policies that uplift all communities. This personal experience drives my dedication to ensuring every voice in our district is heard and represented. Currently, I am a Data Analyst at SEIU Local 1021, supporting union advocacy through data-driven strategies that uplift worker voices and advance labor rights. As a proud member of CWA Local 9404, I am committed to the labor movement and understand the power of collective action in driving progressive change. As Principal of Armadillo Data Services, I lead efforts to provide data solutions that empower organizations to make strategic decisions. My tenure as Data Director for the Colorado Democratic Party Coordinated Campaign sharpened my skills in managing statewide targeting strategies, leading data teams, and driving voter engagement to achieve electoral success. Previously, at Faith in Action, I developed voter engagement strategies and trained staff on outreach methods. My work focused on analyzing demographic shifts to optimize outreach. As Data Director at the New York City Central Labor Council, I deepened labor community engagement through data-driven advocacy, emphasizing underrepresented voices, especially women of color. As an Assembly District Delegate, I will strengthen the Democratic base by amplifying community voices, supporting progressive policies, and fostering inclusive engagement. I will ensure our district is well-represented in endorsements, party platform decisions, and leadership elections. With a background in cultural anthropology and extensive political data experience, I offer a perspective that bridges analysis with activism. I am eager to deepen our communities connection with the statewide Democratic movement, advocating for economic justice, reproductive rights, and democracy. I would be honored to earn your support and move California forward together.

I’m running for Assembly District Delegate to represent AD-14 in the California Democratic Party. I will advocate for wildfire mitigation, access to healthcare, affordable housing, and fiscal responsibility and transparency. With more than 30 years of public service as a teacher, Planning Commissioner, City Councilmember, and Vice Mayor in Berkeley, I offer a balanced, independent, and pragmatic approach. I have the knowledge, experience, and thoughtful perspective to governance that the Democratic Party needs. I have a proven record of effective, data driven problem solving, collaboration, and consensus building. Safety, climate resilience and wildfire mitigation, access to affordable health care, housing for middle-income families, good paying jobs and work conditions, quality schools and education, gun violence prevention, and accountability are my focus. My priorities are based on our shared values: a balanced approach to a fair and just, diverse, democratic, safe, sustainable future. We need leaders who can make good progressive ideas a reality. A few examples of my effective leadership are: •Raising $9 million per year for emergency response and wildfire mitigation efforts in Berkeley through Measure FF (2022). •Founding member and Chair of the East Bay Wildfire Coalition of Governments, approaching climate adaptation from a regional perspective. •Legalizing non permitted secondary units, bringing empty units back into productive use. •Undergrounding power lines along key evacuation routes, keeping residents safe. •Establishing public EV charging stations for residents without access. •Improved communication through the UC/City of Berkeley Relations Committee. I am a life-long Democrat and was the President of the Berkeley Democratic Club for eight years. I also represented the City of Berkeley on regional agencies, collaborating with our neighbors to bring progress to the East Bay. I am running with others on the “Democrats for Progress and Justice” Slate, a group of progressive, and intelligent colleagues with years of proven effectiveness, collective knowledge, and experience. Our slate is endorsed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, and State Senator Jesse Arreguin. Please vote for Susan Wengraf and the “Democrats for Progress and Justice” Slate.

Hello Democrats! I am Cheri Johansen. I have voted Democratic in every election since my college days at the University of Colorado- Go Buffs! Over the years, I have watched as Democrats have moved away from some of the core values I grew up with; supporting working families, prioritizing human rights, and championing transparency in government. As an organizer in California, I have formed alliances with renters, unions, and activist groups. I support election reform - getting big money out of politics. Policies which protect and enrich people’s lives should come before profits. I support an end to military aid in Israel. Our tax dollars should not be funding a humanitarian crisis. I have worked as a member of the Alameda County and Contra Costa County Democratic Central Committees for candidates and on issues supporting single payer universal healthcare, affordable housing, protecting the environment, and public banking. In 2018, I helped lead a successful campaign in the City of Alameda to protect renter’s rights. [btw we were outspent by hundreds of thousands of dollars and still won!] During the 2016 & 2020 elections, I worked to win the City of Alameda’s primary votes for Bernie Sanders; energizing voters to support his ideals with a neighbor-to-neighbor campaign which reached almost every door. As a Board member of Alameda Progressives, we lobbied and won the Declaration of the City of Alameda as a Sanctuary City. I was President of the City of Alameda Democratic Club during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. I am currently a member of Wellstone Democratic Renewal and the West County Democratic Club. I also serve as a Co-Chair of Our Revolution East Bay. I am proud to share a voter card with the Progressive Labor Slate. The ADEM representatives were created to give the grass roots activists and the regular Democrats a voice in the California Democratic Party. I am running because I do believe small ripples joined together can create a wave. I hope to be a part of creating that wave. Thank You for your consideration and for engaging in the ADEM election.

I am running in the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate because I want to support environmental, housing justice, transportation justice, voting reform, social justice, and other progressive issues in the Party. I am proud our slate is endorsed by the Assembly Member Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín. I’ve previously been an AD14 Associate Member and President of the Albany Democratic Club. I served 6 years as Council Member and Mayor in Albany, and a total of 13 years on City Commissions. I am currently a member of the County Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee and elected member of Sierra Club leadership. I co-founded Albany Strollers & Rollers. I am a union member (ATU 1555). We must continue to dissociate completely from fossil fuel interests, and invest in local clean energy. The Party must support the fight against the investor-owned utilities which are trying to make it harder to deploy rooftop solar. Distributed renewable energy is our best bet. At Albany City Council I also helped pass legislation that currently funds climate action programs. The Party must support legislation that breaks down the barriers to building the housing we need at all affordability levels, and keep up the fight for tenant’s rights. I championed legislation that makes housing easier to build in Albany, and have been working as a housing advocate for many years and was endorsed by a number of housing advocacy organizations. Our State must support transportation equity - we need continued and further investment in bus, transit, bicycling, and walking for those who can’t afford the great expense of a car. This investment also furthers the right environmental goals. We should enable people to use clean and efficient transport. The Party must continue to support universal healthcare. California could implement its own program. The Party must also continue to support public education, and public safety, including wildfire safety, and safe streets. As Mayor of Albany, I began the process that culminated in the formation of Albany first Policing Commission providing community oversight of the police, a rarity in such a small City. Also as Mayor, the Pride flag flew for the entire Pride Month for the first time in Albany. I would be honored to have your vote along with the rest of the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. nicky@mindspring.com

I’m running for ADEMS with the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, to build a sustainable California where working families have a chance to thrive. I’ll champion more housing near jobs, schools, and transit, along with fair wages, workers’ rights, and universal healthcare.
For the past four years, I’ve been a pro-housing organizer and leader with East Bay YIMBY and East Bay for Everyone because I know that every home we build deeply changes someone’s life. With these organizations, I’ve led grassroots mobilization for affordable housing near BART, fairer housing elements, and safer streets, especially for bicyclists and pedestrians. I also chair the Sierra Club Northern Alameda County Housing Committee, where we advocate for sustainable infill housing instead of sprawl in high-fire-risk areas.
Housing isn’t the only thing working families need to thrive: we need good, secure jobs where workers are respected and valued. That’s why, when I was at Alphabet, I helped found the Alphabet Workers Union. We fought for living wages for all our coworkers, to make contract workers permanent employees with benefits, for immigrants’ rights in the workplace, to fight gender bias, and to protect from retaliation any colleagues who raised concerns. We also pushed our employer to show up better in the world, demanding they suspend YouTubers engaged in homophobic speech and sever ties with pro-fossil-fuel lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce.
I believe we can build a California where folks can easily find a home to fit their needs, where they can get a secure job, where everyone has healthcare, where we invest in childcare and education, and where we stand up for civil rights for all, but especially LGBTQ rights, immigrants’ rights, and bodily autonomy in these times. I’m proud to be running along with the rest of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, endorsed by State Senator Jesse Arreguín and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, to help advance these progressive causes. Join us!

For 16 years, I have dedicated myself to building just and equitable public schools in Berkeley, CA. As a School Board member, I championed policies and budgets that prioritize our children’s needs, while also achieving an average increase of 30% in educator pay and benefits. My efforts led to improved college eligibility rates, expanded career technical education, and enhanced climate resilience and sustainability plans within BUSD. I focused spending on initiatives which supported Berkeley’s most vulnerable students both socially and academically. As a community leader and organizer, I actively supported initiatives that tackle gun violence, promote affordable housing, enhance mental health services, advocate for sustainable transportation, and address climate change. Through effective governance, I aim to lower California’s poverty rates, enhance our public schools, and partner with organizations that will positively impact the lives of our youth and young adults. I am proud to be part of the Buffy Wick's endorsed Democrats for Progress and Justice slate, committed to electing leaders who will genuinely respond to the needs of our communities. We need leaders with courage, resilience, and tenacity to ensure that the next generation has access to essential human rights: quality education, affordable housing, sustainable healthcare, and a united effort to protect our planet. I will support candidates and initiatives that will prioritize spending wisely, whether facing budget shortfalls or surpluses. As a leader of the next generation and Controller of Global Operations, I understand the importance of outcome-oriented governance. I promise to work diligently to ensure that AD-14 supports efforts and leaders which truly put the needs of the people first.

Fellow Democrats, we MUST ensure that our vital policy deeds match our political words. We must unite to push back against Trump and make sure California is a beacon of democracy and sane policies. We have a strong state Party platform, but it’s only any good if our elected officials pay attention to it. We must work together to have an inclusive, grassroots-oriented state Party, elect liberal-progressive Democrats throughout CA, and hold our state elected leaders accountable. I just finished 12 years on the Oakland City Council, I’m proud to have earned a reputation as an effective policymaker. Throughout my career, I have worked as an environmental policy director, public interest & social justice advocate, and progressive reformer. I continue to be a leader on affordable housing, bold action on climate change, anti-gun violence, emergency preparedness, public education and more. I have decades of experience as a political campaign activist, volunteer and policy advisor. I’m a past VP of the MGO Democratic Club, member of Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club, and longstanding member of the CDP Environmental Caucus. I worked full-time for the Union of Concerned Scientists promoting clean energy and reduced emissions, while standing up to oil companies and other polluters. Most everyone in our Party claims to be an environmentalist. But when push comes to shove, too many public officials forget that commitment. We must elect delegates who are proven climate leaders who will push our elected officials to be as well. I’m a former staff member for CA Common Cause. As a Party delegate, I will continue to advocate for CLEAN MONEY elections! I have the hands-on, rough-and-tumble experience in state party politics, and we need to cut through the bureaucracy and push our Party to take strong action on a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Affordable Housing, Public Education, standing up to the NRA to get guns off our streets, and loudly standing up against hate, racism, antisemitism, and all forms bigotry! I'm 100% pro-choice! Delegates must volunteer on Dem campaigns and help organize others to volunteer. I've done that and will continue to do so. As always, I'm committed to serving with dedication and integrity. Let’s elect strong environmental and social justice leaders in our Party. dan@dankalb.net Democrats for Progress and Social Justice - 14th A.D.

I am running to represent AD14 in the California Democratic Party to advocate for our education system, worker's rights, and universal healthcare. As a member of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, and having the endorsements of Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Jesse Arreguín, I will leverage these relationships to push for effective and sustainable policies. My experience has been primarily in education policy. I ran for the West Contra Costa Unified School District School Board in 2018 and the Contra Costa County Board of Education in 2024. In addition, I've worked as a community organizer. Working with different families, labor partners, and other community stakeholders, I have learned and advocated for progressive education policy to improve our school system. We need policies that support our teachers, set our students up for successful careers, and build upon the community schools model. Worker's rights are always at the forefront of my priorities. My wife, Mitzi Pérez-Caro, is in the middle of her eighth year as a high school teacher, and she previously served on the executive board of her labor union. We can only build upon the community infrastructure we need to pass and implement effective policy by supporting our labor partners. I come from a military background. After losing my 2018 election at 21, I enlisted in the United States Army, serving four years in Active Duty and the last two years in the Army National Guard. As a Sergeant and Non-commissioned Officer, I've learned the meaning of Servant Leadership and would like to continue to serve my community as a delegate to the California Democratic Party. For the last year and a half, I've served as Treasurer to the West County Democratic Club. Having been endorsed by the club and the Democratic Party of Contra Costa County for my past campaigns, I want to do my part to serve our organizations and local Democrats at the state level. I'm committed to helping the party evolve into what it needs to be to serve our communities better. That includes providing my perspective as a member of Gen Z and husband to a teacher. I am running for ADEM because we need a broader approach to pushing for sound and progressive policies. It's not enough to elect the right people into office. We need a party platform that will hold each other accountable to commitments of progress.

Teddy Gray King, AD 14 In this moment of uncertainty, I believe that effective California Democrats are our best hope to promote a sustainable, just, and secure future. As we consider the coming four years, California must stand firm for progressive values like fair housing, climate action, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights. If elected to represent AD 14 at the California Democratic Party, I understand the tasks ahead to make our party more relevant. They include: Reinvigorating voter contact at the neighborhood and community level. Growing state party operations to ensure that Democrats are viable in every district and in every election cycle - not only Presidential elections. Recruiting great candidates. The California Democratic Party should be an instrument in finding and training excellent candidates from diverse backgrounds. We cannot win if we don’t have candidates who connect with voters. As a part of the Democrats for Progress and Justice Slate, I’m proud to have the endorsement of Senator Jesse Arriguin and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. As former mayor of Piedmont, California, I worked to promote progressive and sustainable policies. These include climate action policies that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions in our city, pro-labor contracts to protect city workers - including our first responders - and I made expansion of multi-family housing a cornerstone of my term in office. I am proud that under my leadership, Piedmont adopted a plan to add housing units so that more families with school-age children could benefit from excellent public schools. As a second generation Mexican-American, I care passionately about immigrant communities. That’s why I serve on the board of a non-profit economic development and housing developer that helps to ensure that the Latino community has a fair shot at good jobs, housing, and a quality education. I work every day to promote economic justice for my fellow members of the Latino community We have to be a party that is future focused, that listens to the concerns of every resident. A party capable of rolling up its sleeves and providing effective leadership. I know that by working hard, and working together, we can do just that. I appreciate your vote.

I am a dedicated public servant and have worked in the California State Senate for the past four years, serving the community through the COVID-19 pandemic, for former State Senator Nancy Skinner and now State Senator Jesse Arreguín. As a staffer, I manage casework for essential safety net programs, including the California Rental Assistance Program. I also meet with regional transit partners to ensure the community’s transit needs are heard. I believe my first-hand engagement with the community of AD-14 through my role would make me an excellent delegate as I have a direct ear to constituent concerns. Additionally, I serve as a Planning Commissioner in the City of Pinole, where I strive to be principled in my commitment to meeting the city’s housing needs and access to public transit. As a young professional of color, I would work to advance California’s goals in addressing equity, social justice, and economic opportunity. My professional experiences and personal perspectives help me closely understand the needs of AD-14 and be a more connected representative. I am happy to be running alongside my colleagues on the Democrats for Progress and Justice slate. In addition, I am privileged to have the support of our local state representatives.

Fellow Democrats: I am a lifelong Democrat living in Albany, wishing to contribute my energy and experience to the Party. I lived for 25 years in Berkeley. I am graduate of UC Berkeley. The following is the professional and volunteer experience I will bring to the position — Employment in the Federal Government working in the fields of Environmental Enforcement and Environmental Justice, manager (1987-2013) ; Adult Education Coordinator, American Indian Center, San Francisco (1977-82). I have contributed volunteer time to the following organizations — UN Association East Bay Chapter, 2nd Vice President (2015-present); Berkeley Lions Club, President (2019-2020); Women’s Daytime Drop-in Center, Berkeley, volunteer (2019); Glide Memorial, San Francisco, volunteer. In addition, I have engaged in advocacy at the offices of elected representatives both in the Bay Area and Washington, DC regarding global issues. I would support any effort to partner with local groups in adopting the Sustainable Development Goals, as formulated by the United Nations. I am a Shareholder in an Alaska Native Corporation. As someone with indigenous heritage, I would encourage efforts to acknowledge and support native heritage and history — such as last year’s unanimous vote by the Berkeley City Council to return a 2.2-acre parking lot to the Ohlone people. Immigration issues will of course be in the forefront in coming years. Legislation has emerged that would curtail immigrants’ rights. The Laken Riley Bill, HR 29, if passed, would strengthen the incoming administration’s hand in unleashing mass deportation and breaking apart families. I would support opposing such legislation. I am a member of the following organizations — Albany Democratic Club, Berkeley Democratic Club, Indivisible East Bay, Wellstone, ACLU, League of Women Voters, Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood; National Alliance on Mental Illness; Amnesty International, Intertribal Friendship House, Oakland; National Indian Educaton Association; East Bay Sanctuary Covenant. Thank you for your vote.
